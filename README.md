# Write before body
During the days I develop this project,Jiang Zemin passed away due to leukemia and multiple organ failure in Shanghai at 12:13 pm on Nov 30, 2022, at the age of 96, it was announced on Wednesday.
> Comrade Jiang Zemin was an outstanding leader enjoying high prestige acknowledged by the whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat, a long-tested communist fighter, and an outstanding leader of the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. He was the core of the CPC's third generation of central collective leadership and the principal founder of the Theory of Three Represents.
> Under the Party's third generation of central collective leadership with Jiang at the core, we calmly dealt with a series of breaking international events that concerned China's sovereignty and security, overcame difficulties and risks cropping up in the political and economic spheres and those brought by natural disasters, and always kept China's reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive in the right direction. The great achievements of our Party and country in the 13 years since the fourth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee were inseparable from Jiang's great talent, key role, and exceptional art of political leadership as a Marxist statesman.

It was announced in a letter addressing the whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.

>We must conscientiously study the Theory of Three Represents, learn from Jiang's revolutionary spirit and demeanor, as well as his scientific attitude and creative spirit in applying Marxist stand, viewpoints and methods to studying new circumstances and solving new problems. We must strive in unity to build our country into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful, according to the letter.

**Please mourn him!**

**Comrade Jiang Zemin is immortal!**

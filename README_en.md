# conclusion 综述
这是我第一个开源项目（详见我的个人主页）。若有错误，多多包涵！

This is my first open-source program.If there is any mistake,please pardon me!😁


为了方便老师们在上网课的时候进行随机的点名，开发了这个工具。

In order to help teachers to call students randomly during the online course time,I developed this tool.
# Why this? 好处
1. 随机点名 randomly
2. 在不用的时候收起为悬浮球
make itself to a floating ball when not use.
3. 一次创建多个班，然后在不同的时候选择不同的范围，允许多班一起点名。
Create many classes one stop,and choose different ranges in different situations.it also allows make range of several classes
4. 连续点几个名
Call many names continuously.
5. 历史记录
Make logs when having the class,and watch them after class.
